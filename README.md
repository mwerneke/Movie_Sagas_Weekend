# Movie Sagas Weekend Project

## Description

This was a project that we were given the weekend to complete and was thoroughly enjoyed. The purpose of the project was to Utilize `REACT`, `REDUX`, and `SAGAS`. I created multiple databases that were accessed via the `REACT` application to display a list of Movies that were stored in a Database. The tables table consisted of Data such as Movie title, Genre, Description, Images, and more. The application itself was set up, in a way that on the main page, the list view of Movies would appear with a Title and Movie Image. When you clicked on the Movie image, the details such as the Genre and Movie Description were rendered after being redirected to the individual movie page. In addition to these components, I built a component that had form fields, that took in the pertienent information to capturing details of the movie, including images. This page allowed users to Add their Movie of preference to the Main Movie List while maintaining the same functionality set up in previous components. It also allowed users to Delete.

This project took awhile to build, but was a great model to demonstrate the `Full Stack` in software development.

My `CSS` was fine but due to time constraints, I was able to produce a `Minimal Viable Product` for functioning and demonstrative purposes.
