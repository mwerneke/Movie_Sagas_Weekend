To Do...

[x]Create DB


[]Run the queries from `database.sql`

### Home Component:

[] TODO: When a movie poster is clicked, a user should be brought to the `/details` view for that movie.
[] TODO: Have a way to get to the Add Movie Page

[]### Details Page Component:
This should show all details **including ALL genres** for the selected movie. You will need to store this data in redux!
- TODO: The details page should have a `Back to List` button, which should bring the user to the Home/List Page

### Add Movie Page

This should show:

[] an input field (for the movie title)
[] an input field (for the movie poster image URL))
[]- a textarea (for the movie description)
[] a dropdown (for the genres)

The Add Movie page should have the buttons:

- `Cancel` button, which should bring the user to the Home/List Page
- `Save` button, which should save these inputs in the database and bring the user to the Home/List Page (which now has the new movie)
